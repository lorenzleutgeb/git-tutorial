# Git Tutorial

This Tutorial will guide you making your first steps in using Git and refresh your knowledge about functions in Clojure.

Before drilling right down the rabbithole, let's get a big picture of what we're trying to achieve in the following steps. We will ...

 1. look into a problem scenario that motivates *why* we want to use Git.
 2. find out what Git is, and *how* it solves for us.
 3. *install* Git.
 4. create a separate copy of this repository by *forking* it.
 4. learn how to actually *fetch code from GitHub* using Git, not only boring download buttons.
 5. write a function in Clojure.
 6. use Git to *push* our newly written function back to GitHub.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should make sure that you ...

 1. have a GitHub account and are logged in.
 2. understand the concept of a function (in Clojure).

If any of the two above is not a definite "Yes, I am ready!" for you, please go ahead and immediately sort it out. Maybe find others to help you.
